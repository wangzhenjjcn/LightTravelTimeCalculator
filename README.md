##
It is now 13.721 Gyr since the Big Bang.
##
The age at redshift z was 2.171 Gyr.
##
The light travel time was 11.549 Gyr.
##
The comoving radial distance, which goes into Hubble's law, is 6481.3 Mpc or 21.139 Gly.
##
The comoving volume within redshift z is 1140.389 Gpc3.
##
The angular size distance DA is 1620.3 Mpc or 5.2846 Gly.
##
This gives a scale of 7.855 kpc/".
##
The luminosity distance DL is 25924.3 Mpc or 84.554 Gly.
###
1 Gly = 1,000,000,000 light years or 9.461*1026 cm.
###
1 Gyr = 1,000,000,000 years.
###
1 Mpc = 1,000,000 parsecs = 3.08568*1024 cm, or 3,261,566 light years.
